Try Github Secrets Access with Java

1. Github & Docker Secrets worked as required for infra level secrets: pushing to docker registry.
2. But not working for application level secrets, for that build_args worked but it still prints secret values in image logs in docker registry.

3. With build args also, it did not print secret values in github workflow (masked it with ***, only for secrets) but it printed values in docker image logs (docker hub), which if public image can be problematic...there use valut or docker swarm with docker secret.
